Step 1: Goto https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python

Step 3: Click the green button at the top right of this screen and click "Download ZIP"

Step 4: Extract the zip file to a folder and run the .bat file (this will install the requests module for python)

Step 5: Right click the .py file and open with a text editor like notepad

Step 6: You will see instructions at the top where to put your UUID and API Key and how to get them

Step 7: After making the necessary changes, save and close the file and double click it, this should open the overlay


TROUBLESHOOTING: The "Hypixel Stats Overlay.py" file is not opening and is showing a white page for an icon: Reinstall Python, restart your computer and try again

My stats are only displaying 0's: Make sure you correctly set up your API key and UUID

Running the program resulted in my house catching fire and and I grew and extra arm: Go do some research on ZeerkyClicker.com I think it might be able to help

I'm still really new to this sort of thing, I suck at programming and have never posted on github before. I would love to hear feedback and if you know how to make it look a little nicer let me know lmao :3 discord.gg/Bu86veVgjT
