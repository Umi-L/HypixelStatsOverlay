# Hypixel Statistics Overlay

This is a functioning stats overlay that I made for Hypixel that I'm still trying to figure out how to improve.

Working with: Bedwars, Skywars, and all Duels


## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
Simple video: https://youtu.be/ofJMRicDtrY

### Windows
 - Goto https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version of Python

 - During the installing MAKE SURE to check this box https://imgur.com/a/Cf8EB0z

 - Click the green button at the top right of this screen and click "Download ZIP"

 - Extract the zip file to a folder and run the .bat file (this will install the requests and pyglet(font) modules for python)

 - Right click the .py file and open with a text editor like notepad

 - You will see instructions at the top where to put your UUID and API Key and how to get them

 - After making the necessary changes, save and close the file and double click it, this should open the overlay




## TROUBLESHOOTING
 - The "Hypixel Stats Overlay.py" file is not opening and is showing a white page for an icon: 
	- Reinstall Python, restart your computer and try again

 - My stats are only displaying 0's: 
	- Make sure you correctly set up your API key and UUID
	
 - Running the programmed resulted in my house catching fire and and I grew and extra arm: 
	- Go do some research on ZeerkyClicker.com I think it might be able to help


## Some context
I'm still really new to this sort of thing, I suck at programming and have never posted on github before. I would love to hear feedback and if you know how to make it look a little nicer let me know lmao :3
